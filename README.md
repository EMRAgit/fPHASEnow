## Principle approach
The SQL statement aims at the derivation of phase-specific pheneological events of Winter Wheat. A phenological event emerges when a phase-specific temperature sum is reached wheighted by day lengths. Phase-specific temperatur sums result from the analysis of long-term phenological observations (see  function [fTemperatureSum](https://github.com/EMRAgit/fTemperatureSum)).
