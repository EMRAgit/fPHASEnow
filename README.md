## Principle approach
The SQL statement aims at the derivation of current phase-specific pheneological events of Winter Wheat. A phenological event emerges when a phase-specific temperature sum is reached wheighted by day lengths. Phase-specific temperature sums result from the analysis of long-term phenological observations, which are related to daily temperature sums between 1993 und last year before today (see  function [fTemperatureSum](https://github.com/EMRAgit/fTemperatureSum)).
